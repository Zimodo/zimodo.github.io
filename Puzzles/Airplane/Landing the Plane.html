<p class="rules">Thank you for disabling the autopilot! If you weren't here we may not have made it back to the airport, unfortunately now we have to pilot manually. Let me give you a quick rundown on how this thing works.
Using the YAW, PITCH, and ROLL, position the plane according to the codes I'm going to tell you in just a minute. After every time you reposition the plane find the marshaller, they'll give you a message back.
Since you've never done this before, I'll start with some calibration codes. The first 9 should read UR AIM IS OK, after that you're on your own.</p>
