<p>★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ The nonlinear narrative made it hard to follow what exactly was going on, and it felt like the entire movie was a set up for a bad pun at the end. Yup! Those both are seasons and girl names! (2009)
<br>★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ I'm gonna be real this movie is NOT GOOD but you should watch it anyways, there are so many scenes that made me bust out laughing just from the sheer absurdity, and the fight scenes with Cage and Travolta is a nice breather between them. (1997)
<br>★★★★★★★★★☆ This movie will genuinely scare you. While I respect Aldrich's take on Baby Jane, they really refined their craft on this one. (1964)
<br>★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ This movie is alright if you have nothing else to watch, the satanic cult plot is cheesy and the jokes bring out no laughs. Despite that Tom Hanks did the best with what they got which makes this film at least watchable. (1989)
<br>★★★★★★★★★☆ How they made this movie with only $85 million is mind boggling. Everything flows together so well, and when the heist starts its all so thrilling. Must watch. (2001)
<br>★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ A charming little film. By the end I was rooting for the Rileys to win out against the land developers, and the aliens gave it a little sci-fi kick. (1987)
<br>★★★★★★★★★★ I don't know how, but they managed to make a film about a toy from the '60s supremely cool. I was glued to the screen for the full 118 minutes. (2009)
<br>★★★★★★★★☆☆ The Coen brothers come through with another banger. The 50's aesthetics were a nice touch, though I feel like the pacing was a bit rushed and jokes weren't allowed to breathe (2016)
<br>★★★★★★★★★★ What a way to end the trilogy. Personally I don't care what the retcons are in "Days of Future Past", this is canon to me. (2006)
<br>★★★★★★★★★☆ The beginning of an amazing franchise, Tom Cruise knocked it out of the park with this one. (1996)
<br>★★★★★★★★★☆ The dramatics in the interview really drew me in! Richard was really squirming when David brought watergate up. (2008)
